# 🐶😺 Ai_detect_dog_cat 💡

# 📝 Introduction
This is my first simple project about Ai using for detect and classification images with Convolutional Neural Network.
I created this project because in the future, I want to apply this knowledges into Engineering project at university.

# 🧠 What I learn
- Basic of Machine Learning and Deep Learning (my taking notes live in folder name lecture(taking_notes) ✏️)
- How to balance and manage time between project and another subject (I need to learn another subject from high school 🏫)
- How to apply and solving problem when I stuck at coding (Just use google, AI, youtube ✅)

# 🛣️ What I do
- first I created model with yolo, because it easy for beginnner.
- I created model with open-cv, caer, canaro, tensorflow (I just follow tutorials from youtube and AI)
- I created model with open-cv, sklearn, tensorflow and apply AI to help me when I stuck at coding.

# 🛠️ Challenges
I can't memorize code and how to made it more advances, but I know when stuck at problems.
I just using Google, AI and youtube to solve my problems and learn new things to made my project completely.
(I not want to be coder but I know how to apply to project and how to fix when it not work or I don't know how to made it)

# 📸 Tools I Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Caer
- Canaro
- Scikit-learn
- Visual Studio code
- Google, YouTube, ChatGPT (for learning and help me during coding)

# 📂 Folder Explanation (foldername, description)
- Code => code files using for train and test model.
- Data => data sets for trainning model.
- Dataset_train (for yolo) => specific data sets for yolo model.
- Lecture (taking_notes) => my taking notes while I learn theory from youtube channel DeepLearningAI (andrew ng).
- Model => saved location for models that I train and test completely.

# 🔮Future Plan
I want to apply this knowledge into Engineering projects when I learn at university.

# 📌 Note
This project might not perfect, but It show my learning process.
