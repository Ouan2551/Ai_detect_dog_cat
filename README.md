# 🐶😺 Ai_detect_dog_cat 💡

# 📝 Introduction
This is my first simple project about Ai using for detect and classification images with Convolutional Neural Network.
I created this project because in the future, I want to apply this knowledges into Engineering project at university.

# 🤓 What I learn
- Basic of Machine Learning and Deep Learning (my taking notes live in folder name lecture(taking_notes) ✏️)
- How to balance and manage time between project and another subject (I need to learn another subject from high school 🏫)
- How to apply and solving problem when I stuck at coding (Just use google, AI, youtube ✅)

# 📂 Folder Explanation (foldername, description)
- Code => code file using for train and test model
- Data => data set for trainning model
- Dataset_train (for yolo) => specific data set for yolo model
- Lecture (taking_notes) => my taking notes while I learn theory from youtube channel DeepLearningAI (andrew ng)
- Model => saved location for model that I train and test completely
